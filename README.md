# Project: Healthy Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes healthy life expectancy data across 136 countries using statistical methods. The goal is to explore the distribution, identify key trends, and compare traditional (Excel-based) and AI-assisted analytical approaches.

## Data Source
- **World Happiness Report**  
  URL: [https://worldhappiness.report/data/](https://worldhappiness.report/data/)

- Variable Used: Healthy Life Expectancy (years)

## Objectives
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, range, skewness, etc.)
- Visualize data using bar graphs, pie charts, stem-and-leaf, boxplots, ogives, and area charts
- Apply statistical theorems (Chebyshev, Empirical Rule)
- Compare Excel and AI-based (ChatGPT) analysis

## Key Findings
- Average life expectancy: **64.97 years**
- Highest: **Hong Kong (77.28 years)**  
  Lowest: **Mozambique (51.53 years)**
- No significant outliers found
- AI offers efficiency and ease of interpretation, but cross-verification is advised

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- ChatGPT (for AI-based statistical computation and interpretation)
